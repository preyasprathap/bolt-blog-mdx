# Getting Started with Web Development

Web development can seem overwhelming at first, but with the right approach, anyone can learn it. Let's break down the basics.

## The Three Pillars

The foundation of web development consists of three main technologies:

1. HTML - Structure
2. CSS - Style
3. JavaScript - Interactivity

## HTML Example

Here's a simple HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Next Steps

After mastering the basics, you can explore:

- Frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
- Backend development
- Database management
- Version control with Git

Remember, everyone starts somewhere. Take it step by step, and you'll be building amazing things in no time!
