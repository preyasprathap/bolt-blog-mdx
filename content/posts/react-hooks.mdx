# Understanding React Hooks

React Hooks have transformed how we write React components. Let's explore why they're so powerful.

## Why Hooks?

Hooks solve several problems:
- Reusing stateful logic between components
- Reducing component complexity
- Avoiding class components' confusion with `this`

## useState Example

Here's a simple counter using the useState hook:

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Common Hooks

- useState
- useEffect
- useContext
- useReducer
- useCallback
- useMemo
- useRef

## Best Practices

1. Only call hooks at the top level
2. Only call hooks from React functions
3. Use custom hooks for reusable logic

Keep exploring and experimenting with hooks to master React development!
